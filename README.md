# b19pre-mappings

Unfinished Enigma mappings for Minecraft Beta 1.9 prereleases.

# Notes

I will not be making mappings for b1.9pre5 since MCP is available for that version.

Note that there will be weirdly or stupidly named classes, fields and methods when i was going insane at several points in time.
