# b19pre-mappings

Unfinished Enigma mappings for Minecraft Beta 1.9 prereleases.

These mappings are made with FabricMC's fork of Enigma which can be found here: https://maven.fabricmc.net/cuchaz/enigma-swing/0.27.3/

Specifically version enigma-swing-0.27.3-all.

# Notes

I will __NOT__ be providing any help with using these mappings. You will have to figure that out on your own.

I will not be making mappings for b1.9pre5 since MCP is available for that version.

There will be field_ and func_ names from 1.0.0 MCP as that was used as a base for these mappings.

# Versions
